# FeatherHAB-X

Firmware of [FeatherHAB project](http://protofusion.org/wordpress/2015/10/featherhab-2-gram-high-altitude-balloon-tracker/) by Ethan Zonca with the original code [here](http://hg.protofusion.org/featherhab-firmware/). 

This can be considered a fork and a derivative work. I will keep modifying the firmware and adding features.
